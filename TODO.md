## TODO
1) Pressing issues 
- Make memory management more modular (including main system instructions+moving function schemas that are attached to memory modules)
- Allow user to pick which extra memory modules and function sets are wanted before agent initalisation
2) Essential stuff
- Refine function schema paging 
- allow LLM_Agent to speak to multiple users at once (using semaphores)
3) Other goodies
- Allow it to use function-calling to search the web (selenum?)
